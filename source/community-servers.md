title: Community Servers
---

Screeps is not only a MMO game with the officially maintained open world, but also an open source project. We released [game server software](https://github.com/screeps/screeps) under open license so that everybody can create their own Screeps world and modify it via flexible mod system down to its core, including unique game mechanics and rules, game objects with custom graphics and behavior. 

We like such community activity, this is why we display public quality servers on the game login screen in the Community Servers list.

If you want your server to be included to this list, send an email to [contact@screeps.com](mailto:contact@screeps.com). Your server has to comply with the following rules:

* Server version 3.1.7 or higher.

* Server must have stable online during last 7 days. If it becomes inaccessible for a long time, we'll remove it from the list.

* Use [`config.backend.welcomeText`](https://github.com/screeps/launcher/blob/master/init_dist/example-mods/welcome-text.js) to inform players about any specific features of your server: customizations you have made, installed mods, etc.
