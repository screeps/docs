This tutorial will cover:

Basic C++/C#/VB.NET programming to javascript for screeps

Differences between the languages you need to know


As the languages are similar, this tutorial will cover all 3
This tutorial may also cover similar languages but is explicitly aimed at C#, C++ and VB.NET

#Basics:

## IF statements

In VB you would use this for IF, ElseIF and Else statements:

```Vbnet
If CONDITION Then
	'put your code here
ElseIf CONDITION Then
	'put your code here
Else
	'put your code here
End If
```
C#/C++ code for this is exactaly the same as the javascript:
```javascript
if (CONDITION) 
{

}
else if (CONDITION)
{

}
else
{

}
```
## FOR loops
