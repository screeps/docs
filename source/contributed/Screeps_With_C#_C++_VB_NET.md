Title: Using your knowledge of C#, C++ and VB.NET with Screeps

This tutorial will cover:
Basic VB.NET programming to javascript for screeps
Differences between the languages you need to know


As the languages are similar, this tutorial will cover all 3
This tutorial may also cover similar languages but is explicitly aimed at C#, C++ and VB.NET

#Basics:

## IF statements

In VB you would use this for IF, ElseIF and Else statements:

```Vbnet
If CONDITION Then
	'put your code here
ElseIf CONDITION Then
	'put your code here
Else
	'put your code here
End If
```
C#/C++ code would be:
```C++
if (CONDITION) 
{

}
else if (CONDITION)
{

}
else
{

}
```
Which is very close to javascript
