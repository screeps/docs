title: Insiders Guide to the Screeps Community
---

Programmers and Gamers are both known for building communities, and Screeps is no exception. The Screeps Community is an important aspect of the game and one in which every player should engage in as it provides an excellent resource for help, socializing, and metadiscussion.


## Slack

The [Screeps Slack Network](https://screeps.slack.com) is an extremely active chat community. It has channels for alliances, technical help on a variety of topics, and general socializing.

Slack requires an invite, which can be [obtained here](http://chat.screeps.com/).

The network has a lot of channels, but there are some that deserve mention.

* `#announcements` is for notifications from the game developers, slack moderators, and alliance leads. Chat about announcements should be redirected to `#announcements-any`.
* `#announcements-any` is where people discuss messages sent in `#announcements`.
* `#automation` has a group of users focused on 100% automation for their scripts.
* `#client-abuse` discusses techniques for altering the game client by injecting html and javascript into the client through the in game console.
* `#cpu-clinic` provides help for users who are having trouble figuring out why their bucket is always empty.
* `#economy-clinic` helps users keep their economies flowing.
* `#help` is the general purpose help channel.
* `#loan` is for discussing development of the [League of Automated Nations site](http://www.leagueofautomatednations.com/).
* `#operatingsystems` is filled with users who follow the "operating system model" of development as a way to scale and utilize their CPU.
* `#politics` contains the majority of drama between players.
* `#screepers` focuses on the third party development in the [Screepers github organization](https://github.com/screepers).
* `#screepsplus` is the main support channel for the ScreepsPlus service.
* `#share-thy-code` provides a place to share code. There are many scripts pinned to the channel.
* `#trading` started before the market was introduced and continue to be a resource for discussing trading strategies.


## Forum

The [forums](http://support.screeps.com/hc/en-us/community/topics) provide a venue for more detailed discussions, both technical and about the community. The forums also provide the primary means of communicating with the game developers (short of opening a helpdesk ticket).

Conversations are broken up by topic and include:

* Bug Reports
* Feature Requests
* Help Requsts
* Public Test Realm Issues
* General Discussions

The game developers will often bring up ideas in the forums before implimenting them in the game world so they can take player feedback into account.


## /r/screeps

A less formal community, the [screeps subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/screeps/) provides an excellent resource for assistence for those who don't want to use Slack.


## Steam

The steam community pages for Screeps also provide a [forum](https://steamcommunity.com/app/464350/discussions/), but it tends to be used more for support than in depth discussions.
