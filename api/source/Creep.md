# Creep  


Creeps are your units. Creeps can move, harvest energy, construct structures, attack another creeps, and perform other actions. Each creep consists of up to 50 body parts with the following possible types:

{% api_property body array %}



An array describing the creep’s body. Each element contains the following properties:

{% api_method_params %}

```

An object with the creep's cargo contents. Each object key is one of the <code>RESOURCE_*</code> constants, values are resources amounts. <code>RESOURCE_ENERGY</code> is always defined and equals to 0 when empty, other resources are undefined when empty. You can use <a href="https://github.com/lodash/lodash/blob/3.10.1/doc/README.md#_sumcollection-iteratee-thisarg"><code>lodash.sum</code></a> to get the total amount of contents:



{% api_property carryCapacity number %}

{% api_property memory any %}

```javascript

Upgrade your controller to the next level using carried energy. Upgrading controllers raises your Global Control Level in parallel. Requires <code>WORK</code> and <code>CARRY</code> body parts. The target has to be within 3 squares range of the creep. 

A fully upgraded level 8 controller can't be upgraded over 15 energy units per tick regardless of creeps abilities. The cumulative effect of all the creeps performing <code>upgradeController</code> in the current tick is taken into account. This limit can be increased by using <a href="/minerals.html">ghodium mineral boost</a>.

Upgrading the controller raises its `ticksToDowngrade` timer by 100. The timer must be full in order for controller to be levelled up.

Your creeps can withdraw resources from hostile structures/tombstones as well, in case if there is no hostile rampart on top of it.

This method should not be used to transfer resources between creeps. To transfer between creeps, use the [`transfer`](#Creep.transfer) method on the original creep.
