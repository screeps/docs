{% api_method Game.cpu.getHeapStatistics '' 1 %}

```javascript
let heap = Game.cpu.getHeapStatistics();
console.log(`Used ${heap.total_heap_size} / ${heap.heap_size_limit}`);
```

*This method is only available when **Virtual machine** is set to **Isolated** in your [account runtime settings](https://screeps.com/a/#!/account/runtime).* 

Use this method to get heap statistics for your virtual machine. The return value is almost identical to the Node.js function [`v8.getHeapStatistics()`](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v8.x/docs/api/v8.html#v8_v8_getheapstatistics). This function returns one additional property: `externally_allocated_size` which is the total amount of currently allocated memory which is not included in the v8 heap but counts against this isolate's memory limit. `ArrayBuffer` instances over a certain size are externally allocated and will be counted here.



### Return value

Returns an objects with heap statistics in the following format:

```javascript-content
{
  "total_heap_size": 29085696,
  "total_heap_size_executable": 3670016,
  "total_physical_size": 26447928,
  "total_available_size": 319649520,
  "used_heap_size": 17493824,
  "heap_size_limit": 343932928,
  "malloced_memory": 8192,
  "peak_malloced_memory": 1060096,
  "does_zap_garbage": 0,
  "externally_allocated_size": 38430000
}
```


{% api_method Game.cpu.getUsed '' 1 %}

```javascript
if(Game.cpu.getUsed() > Game.cpu.tickLimit / 2) {
    console.log("Used half of CPU already!");
}
```

```javascript
for(const name in Game.creeps) {
    const startCpu = Game.cpu.getUsed();

    // creep logic goes here

    const elapsed = Game.cpu.getUsed() - startCpu;
    console.log('Creep '+name+' has used '+elapsed+' CPU time');
}

```

Get amount of CPU time used from the beginning of the current game tick. Always returns 0 in the Simulation mode.



### Return value

Returns currently used CPU time as a float number.


{% api_method Game.cpu.halt '' 1 %}

```javascript
Game.cpu.halt();
```

*This method is only available when **Virtual machine** is set to **Isolated** in your [account runtime settings](https://screeps.com/a/#!/account/runtime).*

Reset your runtime environment and wipe all data in heap memory.

{% api_method Game.cpu.setShardLimits 'limits' 1 %}

```javascript
Game.cpu.setShardLimits({shard0: 20, shard1: 10});
```

Allocate CPU limits to different shards. Total amount of CPU should remain equal to 
 [`Game.cpu.shardLimits`](#Game.cpu). This method can be used only once per 12 hours.

{% api_method_params %}
limits : object&lt;string, number&gt;
An object with CPU values for each shard in the same format as `Game.cpu.shardLimits`.
{% endapi_method_params %}


### Return value

One of the following codes:
{% api_return_codes %}
OK | The operation has been scheduled successfully.
ERR_BUSY | 12-hours cooldown period is not over yet.
ERR_INVALID_ARGS | The argument is not a valid shard limits object.
{% endapi_return_codes %}


{% api_method Game.getObjectById 'id' 1 %}

```javascript
creep.memory.sourceId = creep.pos.findClosestByRange(FIND_SOURCES).id;
const source = Game.getObjectById(creep.memory.sourceId);
```

Get an object with the specified unique ID. It may be a game object of any type. Only objects from the rooms which are visible to you can be accessed.

{% api_method_params %}
id : string
The unique identificator.
{% endapi_method_params %}


### Return value

Returns an object instance or null if it cannot be found.

{% api_method Game.notify 'message, [groupInterval]' A %}

```javascript
if(creep.hits < creep.memory.lastHits) {
    Game.notify('Creep '+creep+' has been attacked at '+creep.pos+'!');
}
creep.memory.lastHits = creep.hits;
```

```javascript
if(Game.spawns['Spawn1'].energy == 0) {
    Game.notify(
        'Spawn1 is out of energy',
        180  // group these notifications for 3 hours
    );
}

```

Send a custom message at your profile email. This way, you can set up notifications to yourself on any occasion within the game. You can schedule up to 20 notifications during one game tick. Not available in the Simulation Room.

{% api_method_params %}
message : string
Custom text which will be sent in the message. Maximum length is 1000 characters.
===
groupInterval : number
If set to 0 (default), the notification will be scheduled immediately. Otherwise, it will be grouped with other notifications and mailed out later using the specified time in minutes.
{% endapi_method_params %}
