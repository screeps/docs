# StructureNuker

<img src="img/nuke.png" alt="" align="right" />

Launches a nuke to another room dealing huge damage to the landing area. Each launch has a 
cooldown and requires energy and ghodium resources. Launching creates a 
[Nuke](#Nuke) object at the target room position which is visible to any player until it is landed. 
Incoming nuke cannot be moved or cancelled. Nukes cannot be launched from or to novice rooms. Resources placed into a StructureNuker cannot be withdrawn.
