Produces mineral compounds from base minerals, boosts and unboosts creeps. 
Learn more about minerals from [this article](/minerals.html).

{% page inherited/OwnedStructure.md %}

{% api_property cooldown 'number' %}



The amount of game ticks the lab has to wait until the next reaction or unboost operation is possible.



{% api_property energy 'number' %}



The amount of energy containing in the lab. Energy is used for boosting creeps.



{% api_property energyCapacity 'number' %}



The total amount of energy the lab can contain.



{% api_property mineralAmount 'number' %}



The amount of mineral resources containing in the lab.



{% api_property mineralType 'string' %}



The type of minerals containing in the lab. Labs can contain only one mineral type at the same time.



{% api_property mineralCapacity 'number' %}



The total amount of minerals the lab can contain.



{% api_method boostCreep 'creep, [bodyPartsCount]' A %}



Boosts creep body parts using the containing mineral compound. The creep has to be at adjacent square to the lab. 

{% api_method_params %}
creep : <a href="#Creep">Creep</a>
The target creep.
===
bodyPartsCount (optional) : number
The number of body parts of the corresponding type to be boosted. Body parts are always counted left-to-right for <code>TOUGH</code>, and right-to-left for other types. If undefined, all the eligible body parts are boosted.
{% endapi_method_params %}


### Return value

One of the following codes:
{% api_return_codes %}
OK | The operation has been scheduled successfully.
ERR_NOT_OWNER | You are not the owner of this lab.
ERR_NOT_FOUND | The mineral containing in the lab cannot boost any of the creep's body parts.
ERR_NOT_ENOUGH_RESOURCES | The lab does not have enough energy or minerals.
ERR_INVALID_TARGET | The targets is not valid creep object.
ERR_NOT_IN_RANGE | The targets are too far away.
ERR_RCL_NOT_ENOUGH | Room Controller Level insufficient to use this structure.
{% endapi_return_codes %}



{% api_method runReaction 'lab1, lab2' A %}



Produce mineral compounds using reagents from two other labs. The same input labs can be used by many output labs.

{% api_method_params %}
lab1 : <a href="#StructureLab">StructureLab</a> (lab)
The first source lab.
===
lab2 : <a href="#StructureLab">StructureLab</a> (lab)
The second source lab.
{% endapi_method_params %}


### Return value

One of the following codes:
{% api_return_codes %}
OK | The operation has been scheduled successfully.
ERR_NOT_OWNER | You are not the owner of this lab.
ERR_NOT_ENOUGH_RESOURCES | The source lab do not have enough resources.
ERR_INVALID_TARGET | The targets are not valid lab objects.
ERR_FULL | The target cannot receive any more energy.
ERR_NOT_IN_RANGE | The targets are too far away.
ERR_INVALID_ARGS | The reaction cannot be run using this resources.
ERR_TIRED | The lab is still cooling down.
ERR_RCL_NOT_ENOUGH | Room Controller Level insufficient to use this structure.
{% endapi_return_codes %}



{% api_method transfer 'target, resourceType, [amount]' A '{"deprecated": "Please use [`Creep.withdraw`](#Creep.withdraw) instead."}' %}


Transfer resource from this structure to a creep. The target has to be at adjacent square. You can transfer resources to your creeps from hostile structures as well.

{% api_method_params %}
target : <a href="#Creep">Creep</a>
The target object.
===
resourceType : string
One of the <code>RESOURCE_*</code> constants.
===
amount (optional) : number
The amount of resources to be transferred. If omitted, all the available amount is used.
{% endapi_method_params %}


### Return value

One of the following codes:
{% api_return_codes %}
OK | The operation has been scheduled successfully.
ERR_NOT_OWNER | You are not the owner of the target creep, or there is a hostile rampart on top of the structure.
ERR_NOT_ENOUGH_RESOURCES | The creep does not have the given amount of resources.
ERR_INVALID_TARGET | The target is not a valid Creep object.
ERR_FULL | The target cannot receive any more energy.
ERR_NOT_IN_RANGE | The target is too far away.
ERR_INVALID_ARGS | The amount or resource type is incorrect.
{% endapi_return_codes %}



{% api_method unboostCreep 'creep' A %}


Immediately remove boosts from the creep and drop 50% of the mineral compounds used to boost it onto the ground regardless of the creep's remaining time to live. The creep has to be at adjacent square to the lab. Unboosting requires cooldown time equal to the total sum of the reactions needed to produce all the compounds applied to the creep.

{% api_method_params %}
creep : <a href="#Creep">Creep</a>
The target creep.
{% endapi_method_params %}


### Return value

One of the following codes:
{% api_return_codes %}
OK | The operation has been scheduled successfully.
ERR_NOT_OWNER | You are not the owner of this lab, or the target creep.
ERR_INVALID_TARGET | The target is not a valid Creep object.
ERR_TIRED | The lab is still cooling down.
ERR_NOT_IN_RANGE | The target is too far away.
ERR_NOT_FOUND | The target has no boosted parts.
ERR_RCL_NOT_ENOUGH | Room Controller Level insufficient to use this structure.
{% endapi_return_codes %}
