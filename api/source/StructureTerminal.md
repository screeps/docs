# StructureTerminal

<img src="img/terminal.png" alt="" align="right" />

Sends any resources to a Terminal in another room. The destination Terminal can belong to any player. 
Each transaction requires additional energy (regardless of the transfer resource type) that can be 
calculated using [`Game.market.calcTransactionCost`](#Game.market.calcTransactionCost) method. 
For example, sending 1000 mineral units from W0N0 to W10N5 will consume 742 energy units. 
You can track your incoming and outgoing transactions using the [`Game.market`](#Game.market) object. 
Only one Terminal per room is allowed that can be addressed by [`Room.terminal`](#Room.terminal) property.

Terminals are used in the [Market system](/market.html).

{% api_property cooldown 'number' %}

The remaining amount of ticks while this terminal cannot be used to make [`StructureTerminal.send`](#StructureTerminal.send) or [`Game.market.deal`](#Game.market.deal) calls.


{% api_property store 'object' %}

```javascript
if( !(RESOURCE_UTRIUM in Game.rooms['W1N1'].terminal.store) ) {
    // need more utrium!
}
```

```javascript
const total = _.sum(Game.rooms['W1N1'].terminal.store);
```

An object with the storage contents. Each object key is one of the <code>RESOURCE_*</code> constants, values are resources amounts. <code>RESOURCE_ENERGY</code> is always defined and equals to 0 when empty, other resources are undefined when empty. You can use <a href="https://github.com/lodash/lodash/blob/3.10.1/doc/README.md#_sumcollection-iteratee-thisarg"><code>lodash.sum</code></a> to get the total amount of contents.



{% api_property storeCapacity 'number' %}



The total amount of resources the storage can contain.



{% api_method send 'resourceType, amount, destination, [description]' A %}

```javascript
Game.rooms['W1N1'].terminal.send(RESOURCE_UTRIUM, 100, 'W2N3',
	'trade contract #1');
```

Sends resource to a Terminal in another room with the specified name.

{% api_method_params %}

ERR_NOT_ENOUGH_RESOURCES | The structure does not have the required amount of resources.
ERR_INVALID_ARGS | The arguments provided are incorrect.
ERR_TIRED | The terminal is still cooling down. 
{% endapi_return_codes %}



{% api_method transfer 'target, resourceType, [amount]' A '{"deprecated": "Please use [`Creep.withdraw`](#Creep.withdraw) instead."}' %}

```javascript
Game.rooms['W1N1'].terminal.transfer(creep, RESOURCE_ENERGY);
```
